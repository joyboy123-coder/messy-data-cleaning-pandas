# 🧹 Messy Data Cleaning with Pandas

Welcome to the jungle of messy datasets and the beauty of cleaning them up using Python’s Pandas library.  
This project is all about showing how real-world data is *never perfect*, and how we can fix it like a boss 🧠💪

## 📁 Folder Structure

**🗂 notebook/**  
💻 All the action happens here. This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks with different messy datasets and how they were cleaned step by step using pandas.

**📉 data/**  
🗃 This is where the raw, messy CSVs live. You'll also find an empty `cleaned_data.csv` file here—this is where the cleaned output will be saved after running the notebooks.

**🖼 images/**  
📸 Just some visuals, including before-after shots or reference screenshots. Mostly used to enhance the README or show results of cleaning.

## 🚀 How to Use This Project

1. **📥 Clone the repo**  
   First, clone this repository to your machine.

2. **⚙️ Install the requirements**  
   Make sure you have Python and Pandas installed. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab is recommended.

3. **🧾 Run the notebook**  
   Go to the `notebook/` folder and open any `.ipynb` file.

4. **🧠 Follow the prompts**  
   The notebook will ask you to input:
   - ✅ **The path to your messy CSV file** – just copy the file path from the `data/` folder.
   - ✅ **The path to save the cleaned file** – copy the path to `cleaned_data.csv` (already present inside `data/`, but currently empty).

   It’ll use `.to_csv()` to write the cleaned version into that file.

5. **🔍 Check your output**  
   Head to `data/cleaned_data.csv` – you’ll see the cleaned dataset there!

6. **🖼 See the cleaning process visually**  
   Go to `images/` and check out before vs after screenshots of the datasets.
